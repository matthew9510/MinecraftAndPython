#### Welcome to programming in Python with Minecraft 

I am excited for this journey and believe it will help me become closer to being a master of Python.

Through this journey I will be reading and working along a book called **[Learn To Program With Minecraft by Craig Richardson](https://nostarch.com/programwithminecraft)**

#### Overview
- Chapter 1 focused on installing Minecraft along with the Minecraft api 
- [Chapter 2: Teleporting with variables notes](https://github.com/matthew9510/MinecraftAndPython/blob/master/Code/Chapter%202/Book_Notes.md) 
- [Chapter 3: Building quickly and traveling far with math notes]()
